# Project 3 - InspireExpire Sophrologie - Symfony 5.*

It's symfony website-skeleton project with some additional tools to validate code standards.

* GrumPHP, as pre-commit hook, will run 2 tools when `git commit` is run :

  * PHP_CodeSniffer to check PSR12
  * PHPStan focuses on finding errors in your code (without actually running it)
  * PHPmd will check if you follow PHP best practices

  If tests fail, the commit is canceled and a warning message is displayed to developper.

* Github Action as Continuous Integration will be run when a branch with active pull request is updated on github. It will run :

  * Tasks to check if vendor, .idea, env.local are not versionned,
  * PHP_CodeSniffer, PHPStan and PHPmd with same configuration as GrumPHP.

Launch your server and read the instructions.
